msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With re-purposing the printhead's fan pwm output, you can control lasers or "
"spindles. This is useful if you use switchable print heads, for example the "
"E3D toolchanger or a DIY solution. Usually, cam-tools such as LaserWeb can "
"be configured to use `M3-M5` commands, which stand for *spindle speed CW* "
"(`M3 S[0-255]`), *spindle speed CCW* (`M4 S[0-255]`) and *spindle stop* "
"(`M5`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Warning:** When driving a laser, keep all security precautions that you "
"can think of! Diode lasers are usually inverted. This means, that when the "
"MCU restarts, the laser will be *fully on* for the time it takes the MCU to "
"start up again. For good measure, it is recommended to *always* wear "
"appropriate laser-goggles of the right wavelength if the laser is powered; "
"and to disconnect the laser when it is not needed. Also, you should "
"configure a safety timeout, so that when your host or MCU encounters an "
"error, the tool will stop."

msgid "Current Limitations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a limitation of how frequent PWM updates may occur. While being "
"very precise, a PWM update may only occur every 0.1 seconds, rendering it "
"almost useless for raster engraving. However, there exists an [experimental "
"branch](https://github.com/Cirromulus/klipper/tree/laser_tool) with its own "
"tradeoffs. In long term, it is planned to add this functionality to main-"
"line klipper."
