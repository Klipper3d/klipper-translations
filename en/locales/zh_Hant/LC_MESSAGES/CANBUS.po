"Klipper currently only supports CAN on stm32 chips. In addition, the micro-"
"controller chip must support CAN and it must be on a board that has a CAN "
"transceiver."
msgstr "Klipper目前只支援 stm32 晶片的CAN。此外，微控制器晶片必須支援 CAN，而且你使用的主板必須有 CAN 收發器。"

"In order to use a CAN bus, it is necessary to have a host adapter. There are"
" currently two common options:"
msgstr "爲了使用 CAN 匯流排，主機需要一個適配器。目前有兩種常見的選擇："

msgid ""
"Use a [Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat](https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-"
"hat.htm) or one of its many clones."
msgstr ""
"使用[Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat](https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-"
"hat.htm)或其眾多克隆中的一個。"

msgid ""
"It is also necessary to configure the host operating system to use the "
"adapter. This is typically done by creating a new file named "
"`/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` with the following contents:"
msgstr ""
"還需要將主機操作系統配置為使用適配器。通常可以通過建立一個名為 `/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` "
"的新檔案來實現，該檔案包含以下內容："

msgid ""
"Note that the \"Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" also requires [changes to "
"config.txt](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT)."
msgstr ""
"注意，\"Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" 需要額外[對 config.txt "

msgid "Terminating Resistors"
msgstr "終端電阻"

msgid ""
"A CAN bus should have two 120 ohm resistors between the CANH and CANL wires."
" Ideally, one resistor located at each the end of the bus."
msgstr "CAN匯流排在 CANH 和 CANL 導線之間必須兩個 120 歐姆的電阻。理想情況下，匯流排的兩端各有一個電阻。"

msgid ""
"Note that some devices have a builtin 120 ohm resistor (for example, the "
"\"Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" has a soldered on resistor that can not "
"be easily removed). Some devices do not include a resistor at all. Other "
"devices have a mechanism to select the resistor (typically by connecting a "
"\"pin jumper\"). Be sure to check the schematics of all devices on the CAN "
"bus to verify that there are two and only two 120 Ohm resistors on the bus."
msgstr ""
"請注意，有些裝置有一個內建的120歐姆電阻（例如，\"Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN "
"hat\"有一個難以拆除的貼片電阻）。有些裝置根本不帶有一個電阻。其他裝置有一個選擇電阻的機制（通常是一個跳線）。一定要檢查 CAN "
"匯流排上所有裝置的原理圖，以確認匯流排上有兩個而且只有兩個120歐姆的電阻。"

msgid ""
"To test that the resistors are correct, one can remove power to the printer "
"and use a multi-meter to check the resistance between the CANH and CANL "
"wires - it should report ~60 ohms on a correctly wired CAN bus."
msgstr ""
"要測試電阻是否正確，先切斷印表機的電源，並用多用表檢查 CANH 和 CANL 線之間的阻值—在正確接線的 CAN 匯流排上，它應該報告大約60 歐姆。"

msgid "Finding the canbus_uuid for new micro-controllers"
msgstr "尋找新微控制器的 canbus_uuid"

msgid ""
"Each micro-controller on the CAN bus is assigned a unique id based on the "
"factory chip identifier encoded into each micro-controller. To find each "
"micro-controller device id, make sure the hardware is powered and wired "
"correctly, and then run:"
msgstr ""
"CAN 匯流排上的每個微控制器都根據編碼到每個微控制器中的工廠晶片識別符號分配了一個唯一的 ID。要查詢每個微控制器裝置 "
"ID，請確保硬體已正確供電和接線，然後執行："

msgid ""
"If uninitialized CAN devices are detected the above command will report "
"lines like the following:"
msgstr "如果檢測到未初始化的 CAN 裝置，上述命令將報告如下行："

msgid ""
"Each device will have a unique identifier. In the above example, "
"`11aa22bb33cc` is the micro-controller's \"canbus_uuid\"."
msgstr "每個裝置將有一個獨特的識別符號。在上面的例子中，`11aa22bb33cc`是微控制器'的\"canbus_uuid\" 。"

msgid ""
"Note that the `canbus_query.py` tool will only report uninitialized devices "
"- if Klipper (or a similar tool) configures the device then it will no "
"longer appear in the list."
msgstr ""
"注意，`canbus_query.py` 工具只會只報告未初始化的裝置—如果Klipper（或類似工具）已經配置了裝置，那麼它不會在列表中。"
