"Klipper supports a mechanism for homing with an endstop attached to one "
"micro-controller while its stepper motors are on a different micro-"
"controller. This support is referred to as \"multi-mcu homing\". This "
"feature is also used when a Z probe is on a different micro-controller than "
"the Z stepper motors."
msgstr ""
"Klipper podporuje mechanismus homingu s koncovým spínačem připojeným k "
"jednomu mikrokontroléru, zatímco krokové motory jsou připojeny k jinému "
"mikrokontroléru. Tato podpora je označována jako \"multi-mcu homing\". Tato "
"funkce se také používá, když je snímač Z na jiném mikrokontroléru než "
"krokové motory Z."

msgid ""
"This feature can be useful to simplify wiring, as it may be more convenient "
"to attach an endstop or probe to a closer micro-controller. However, using "
"this feature may result in \"overshoot\" of the stepper motors during homing"
" and probing operations."
msgstr ""

#: docs/Multi_MCU_Homing.md:block 4 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"The overshoot occurs due to possible message transmission delays between the"
" micro-controller monitoring the endstop and the micro-controllers moving "
"the stepper motors. The Klipper code is designed to limit this delay to no "
"more than 25ms. (When multi-mcu homing is activated, the micro-controllers "
"send periodic status messages and check that corresponding status messages "
"are received within 25ms.)"

msgid ""
"So, for example, if homing at 10mm/s then it is possible for an overshoot of"
" up to 0.250mm (10mm/s * .025s == 0.250mm). Care should be taken when "
"configuring multi-mcu homing to account for this type of overshoot. Using "
"slower homing or probing speeds can reduce the overshoot."
msgstr ""

#: docs/Multi_MCU_Homing.md:block 6 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Stepper motor overshoot should not adversely impact the precision of the "
"homing and probing procedure. The Klipper code will detect the overshoot and"
" account for it in its calculations. However, it is important that the "
"hardware design is capable of handling overshoot without causing damage to "
"the machine."

#: docs/Multi_MCU_Homing.md:block 7 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Should Klipper detect a communication issue between micro-controllers during"
" multi-mcu homing then it will raise a \"Communication timeout during "
"homing\" error."
msgstr ""

#: docs/Multi_MCU_Homing.md:block 8 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Note that an axis with multiple steppers (eg, `stepper_z` and `stepper_z1`) "
"need to be on the same micro-controller in order to use multi-mcu homing. "
"For example, if an endstop is on a separate micro-controller from "
"`stepper_z` then `stepper_z1` must be on the same micro-controller as "
"`stepper_z`."
