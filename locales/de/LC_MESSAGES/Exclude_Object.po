"Unlike other 3D printer firmware options, a printer running Klipper utilizes"
" a suite of components and users have many options to choose from. "
"Therefore, in order to provide a a consistent user experience, the "
"`[exclude_object]` module will establish a contract or API of sorts. The "
"contract covers the contents of the gcode file, how the internal state of "
"the module is controlled, and how that state is provided to clients."

"The specialized gcode processing needed to support excluding objects does "
"not fit into Klipper's core design goals. Therefore, this module requires "
"that the file is processed before being sent to Klipper for printing. Using "
"a post-process script in the slicer or having middleware process the file on"
" upload are two possibilities for preparing the file for Klipper. A "
"reference post-processing script is available both as an executable and a "
"python library, see [cancelobject-"

"The `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` command is used to provide a summary of each "

"the file. Objects don't need to be defined in order to be referenced by "
"other commands. The primary purpose of this command is to provide "
"information to the UI without needing to parse the entire gcode file."

"Object definitions are named, to allow users to easily select an object to "
"be excluded, and additional metadata may be provided to allow for graphical "
"cancellation displays. Currently defined metadata includes a `CENTER` X,Y "
"coordinate, and a `POLYGON` list of X,Y points representing a minimal "
"outline of the object. This could be a simple bounding box, or a complicated"
" hull for showing more detailed visualizations of the printed objects. "
"Especially when gcode files include multiple parts with overlapping bounding"
" regions, center points become hard to visually distinguish. `POLYGONS` must"
" be a json-compatible array of point `[X,Y]` tuples without whitespace. "
"Additional parameters will be saved as strings in the object definition and "
"provided in status updates."
