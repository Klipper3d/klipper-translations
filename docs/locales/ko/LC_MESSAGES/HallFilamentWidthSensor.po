"This document describes Filament Width Sensor host module. Hardware used for"
" developing this host module is based on Two Hall liniar sensors (ss49e for "
"example). Sensors in the body are located opposite sides. Principle of "
"operation : two hall sensors work in differential mode, temperature drift "
"same for sensor. Special temperature compensation not needed. You can find "
"designs at [thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4138933)"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sensor generates two analog output based on calculated filament width. Sum "
"of output voltage always equals to detected filament width . Host module "
"monitors voltage changes and adjusts extrusion multiplier. I use aux2 "
"connector on ramps-like board analog11 and analog12 pins. You can use "
"different pins and differenr boards"
