"Software based skew correction can help resolve dimensional inaccuracies "

" your printer is significantly skewed it is strongly recommended to first "
"use mechanical means to get your printer as square as possible prior to "
"applying software based correction."

"基于软件的偏斜校正可以帮助解决打印机装配不完全方形造成的尺寸不准确问题。请注意，如果您的打印机严重偏斜，强烈建议在应用基于软件的校正之前，首先使用机械手段使打印机尽可能的方形。"

"The first step in correcting skew is to print a [calibration "
"object](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2563185/files) along the plane you"
" want to correct. There is also a [calibration "
"object](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2972743) that includes all planes "
"in one model. You want the object oriented so that corner A is toward the "
"origin of the plane."

"纠正偏斜的第一步是沿着你要纠正的平面打印一个[校准物件](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2563185/files)。还有一个[校准物件](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2972743)包括了一个模型中的所有平面。你需要旋转这个物件，使角A朝向平面的原点。"

"在配置了 skew_correction 之后，你可以在启用修正的情况下重新打印校准物件。使用下面的 G-Code "

msgid ""
"Due to the nature of skew correction it is recommended to configure skew in "
"your start gcode, after homing and any kind of movement that travels near "
"the edge of the print area such as a purge or nozzle wipe. You may use use "

msgstr ""
"由于偏斜校正的性质，建议之在归位和任何类型的靠近打印区域边缘的运动（如清除或喷嘴擦除）完成之后的开始打印 G-Code 中配置偏斜校正。您可以使用 "
"`SET_SKEW` 或 `SKEW_PROFILE` G-Code 来完成此操作。还建议在结束打印 G-Code 中发出 `SET_SKEW "
"CLEAR=1`。"
