"transceiver."

"flash it to the target board."
msgstr ""
"要为 CAN 编译固件，请运行“make menuconfig”并选择“CAN bus”作为通信接口。最后，编译微控制器代码并将其刷写到目标板上。"

msgstr ""
"使用[Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat](https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-hat."

msgid ""
"It is also necessary to configure the host operating system to use the "
"adapter. This is typically done by creating a new file named "
"`/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` with the following contents:"
msgstr ""
"还需要将主机操作系统配置为使用适配器。通常可以通过创建一个名为 `/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` "

msgid ""
"A CAN bus should have two 120 ohm resistors between the CANH and CANL wires."
" Ideally, one resistor located at each the end of the bus."
msgstr "CAN总线在 CANH 和 CANL 导线之间必须两个 120 欧姆的电阻。理想情况下，总线的两端各有一个电阻。"

msgid ""
"Note that some devices have a builtin 120 ohm resistor (for example, the "
"\"Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat\" has a soldered on resistor that can not "
"be easily removed). Some devices do not include a resistor at all. Other "
"devices have a mechanism to select the resistor (typically by connecting a "
"\"pin jumper\"). Be sure to check the schematics of all devices on the CAN "
"bus to verify that there are two and only two 120 Ohm resistors on the bus."
msgstr ""
"请注意，有些设备有一个内置的120欧姆电阻（例如，\"Waveshare Raspberry Pi CAN hat\"有一个难以拆除的贴片电阻"

"总线上所有设备的原理图，以确认总线上有两个而且只有两个120欧姆的电阻。"

msgid ""
"To test that the resistors are correct, one can remove power to the printer "
"and use a multi-meter to check the resistance between the CANH and CANL "
"wires - it should report ~60 ohms on a correctly wired CAN bus."
msgstr ""
"要测试电阻是否正确，先切断打印机的电源，并用多用表检查 CANH 和 CANL 线之间的阻值—在正确接线的 CAN 总线上，它应该报告大约60 欧姆。"
