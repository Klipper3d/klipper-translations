"If the probe has an X or Y offset and the bed tilt is changed (eg, by "

msgid "Repeatability check"
msgstr "重复性测试"

msgid ""
"After calibrating the probe X, Y, and Z offsets it is a good idea to verify "
"that the probe provides repeatable results. Start by homing the printer and "
"then move the head to a position near the center of the bed. Navigate to the"
" OctoPrint terminal tab and run the `PROBE_ACCURACY` command."
msgstr ""
"在完成探针的X、Y、Z偏移的校准后，推荐进行探针的重复性测试。首先对打印机进行三周归零，然后将喷嘴移动到热床的中央位置。进入OctoPrint的命令行界面"
"，执行`PROBE_ACCURACY`命令。"

msgid ""
"This command will run the probe ten times and produce output similar to the "
"following:"
msgstr "该命令会就地进行10次探针测量，并输出类似下方的结果："

msgid ""
"Ideally the tool will report an identical maximum and minimum value. (That "
"is, ideally the probe obtains an identical result on all ten probes.) "
"However, it's normal for the minimum and maximum values to differ by one Z "
"\"step distance\" or up to 5 microns (.005mm). A \"step distance\" is "
"`rotation_distance/(full_steps_per_rotation*microsteps)`. The distance "
"between the minimum and the maximum value is called the range. So, in the "
"above example, since the printer uses a Z step distance of .0125, a range of"
" 0.012500 would be considered normal."
msgstr ""
"理想状况下，使用探针测量的所有结果应该一致（也就是10次测量的结果为同一值）。然而，测量结果的最大值和最小值之间差距 “一个z电机步长”或5微米，也是正常"
"的情况。一个“电机步长”是`旋转一周的长度/(旋转一周需要的步数*驱动微步设置)`。测量最大值和最小值的差值称为偏差范围。故在上述的例子中，因为打印机的z"
"步长为0.0125，因此误差范围在0.012500mm可以认为是正常值。"

msgid ""
"If the results of the test show a range value that is greater than 25 "
"microns (.025mm) then the probe does not have sufficient accuracy for "
"typical bed leveling procedures. It may be possible to tune the probe speed "
"and/or probe start height to improve the repeatability of the probe. The "
"`PROBE_ACCURACY` command allows one to run tests with different parameters "
"to see their impact - see the [G-Codes document](G-Codes.md) for further "
"details. If the probe generally obtains repeatable results but has an "
"occasional outlier, then it may be possible to account for that by using "
"multiple samples on each probe - read the description of the probe `samples`"
" config parameters in the [config reference](Config_Reference.md#probe) for "
"more details."
msgstr ""
"如果测量的结果显示误差范围大于25微米（0.025mm），受测的探针则不能满足热床调平的要求。通过调整探针测试的速度和/或探针测试的起始高度，有可能获得更"
"佳的可重复性。`PROBE_ACCURACY`命令允许用户以不同的条件进行测试，详情参考[G代码文档](G-Codes."
"md)。如果探针在多次测量中偶发性出现大偏差的读值，可以通过单点多次测量功能抑制偶发偏差，详情参考[配置参考](Config_Reference."
"md#probe)中探针`samples`部分。"

msgid ""
"If new probe speed, samples count, or other settings are needed, then update"
" the printer.cfg file and issue a `RESTART` command. If so, it is a good "
"idea to [calibrate the z_offset](#calibrating-probe-z-offset) again. If "
"repeatable results can not be obtained then don't use the probe for bed "
"leveling. Klipper has several manual probing tools that can be used instead "
"- see the [Bed Level document](Bed_Level.md) for further details."
msgstr ""
"要更改探针测试速度，重复采样或其他设置，应在修改printer.cfg使用`RESTART`命令以应用修改值。推荐在使用新设置值后再进行一次[Z偏移校准"
"](#calibrating-probe-z-offset)。如果重复性测试结论不能接受，建议不要使用自动热床调平功能。Klipper提供了数种手动调平的"

msgid "Location Bias Check"
msgstr "局部偏差确定"

msgid ""
"Some probes can have a systemic bias that corrupts the results of the probe "
"at certain toolhead locations. For example, if the probe mount tilts "
"slightly when moving along the Y axis then it could result in the probe "
"reporting biased results at different Y positions."
msgstr "一些探针可能具有与位置相关的系统性偏差。比如，由于探针安装失误，探针沿Y轴移动会产生倾斜，那么探针在沿Y轴进行测量得出的结果会存在偏差。"

msgid ""
"This is a common issue with probes on delta printers, however it can occur "
"on all printers."
msgstr "上述状况往往出现在三角洲打印机上，然而，所有打印机均有可能发生上述状况。"

msgid ""
"One can check for a location bias by using the `PROBE_CALIBRATE` command to "
"measuring the probe z_offset at various X and Y locations. Ideally, the "
"probe z_offset would be a constant value at every printer location."
msgstr ""
"我们可以在不同的XY位置上使用`PROBE_CALIBRATE`命令测量z_offset来确定位置偏差。理想情况下，z_offset在任意位置均为同一读值"
"。"

msgid ""
"For delta printers, try measuring the z_offset at a position near the A "
"tower, at a position near the B tower, and at a position near the C tower. "
"For cartesian, corexy, and similar printers, try measuring the z_offset at "
"positions near the four corners of the bed."
msgstr ""
"对于三角洲打印机，请尝试依次在靠近A柱、B柱和C柱的位置测量z_offset。对于龙门、corexy或类似结构打印机，尝试在热床的四个角进行z_offse"
"t的测量。"

msgid ""
"Before starting this test, first calibrate the probe X, Y, and Z offsets as "
"described at the beginning of this document. Then home the printer and "
"navigate to the first XY position. Follow the steps at [calibrating probe Z "
"offset](#calibrating-probe-z-offset) to run the `PROBE_CALIBRATE` command, "
"`TESTZ` commands, and `ACCEPT` command, but do not run `SAVE_CONFIG`. Note "
"the reported z_offset found. Then navigate to the other XY positions, repeat"
" these `PROBE_CALIBRATE` steps, and note the reported z_offset."
msgstr ""
"在进行上述测试前，应先按照本文档的开头部分对X、Y、Z的偏移值进行校准，然后对打印机进行归零，并将探针移动到首个目标XY位置。按照[探针Z偏移值校准](#"
"探针Z偏移值校准)的步骤，运行`PROBE_CALIBRATE`，重复多次`TESTZ`命令，并在喷嘴触床时使用 `ACCEPT`命令，但是**切勿使用 "
"`SAVE_CONFIG`**。手动记下此时的z_offset "
"。之后将探针移动到其他XY位置，重复上述的`PROBE_CALIBRATE`步骤，并分别记下z_offset。"

msgid ""
"If the difference between the minimum reported z_offset and the maximum "
"reported z_offset is greater than 25 microns (.025mm) then the probe is not "
"suitable for typical bed leveling procedures. See the [Bed Level "
"document](Bed_Level.md) for manual probe alternatives."
msgstr ""
"如果上述方法中测出的最大z_offset 和最小z_offset 之间的差值大于25微米（.025mm），则该探针不适用于常规的热床调平。此时应参照 "

"probe is at a higher temperature."
msgstr "对于多种形式的探针，在不同的温度下工作均具有一定的系统性偏差。比如，在高温下，探针可能总是在更低的高度下触发。"

msgid ""
"It is recommended to run the bed leveling tools at a consistent temperature "
"to account for this bias. For example, either always run the tools when the "
"printer is at room temperature, or always run the tools after the printer "
"has obtained a consistent print temperature. In either case, it is a good "
"idea to wait several minutes after the desired temperature is reached, so "
"that the printer apparatus is consistently at the desired temperature."
msgstr ""
"针对这种偏差，建议在恒定的温度下进行热床调平。即，要么总是在室温下进行床网测量，要么总要在工作温度下进行。无论采取哪种方案，都推荐在达到目标温度数分钟后再"

msgid ""
"To check for a temperature bias, start with the printer at room temperature "
"and then home the printer, move the head to a position near the center of "
