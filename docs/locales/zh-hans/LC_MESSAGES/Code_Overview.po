"Klipper uses an [iterative solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-"

"step times given a function that calculates a stepper position from a time. "
"This is done by repeatedly \"guessing\" various times until the stepper "
"position formula returns the desired position of the next step on the "
"stepper. The feedback produced from each guess is used to improve future "
"guesses so that the process rapidly converges to the desired time. The "

"The next major step is to compress the steps: `stepcompress_flush() -> "

"Processing of the queue_step commands on the micro-controller starts in "

" each queue_step command to a per stepper queue. Under normal operation the "
"queue_step command is parsed and queued at least 100ms before the time of "
"its first step. Finally, the generation of stepper events is done in "
"`stepper_event()`. It's called from the hardware timer interrupt at the "
"scheduled time of the first step. The stepper_event() code generates a step "
"pulse and then reschedules itself to run at the time of the next step pulse "
"for the given queue_step parameters. The parameters for each queue_step "
"command are \"interval\", \"count\", and \"add\". At a high-level, "

msgid ""
"Fundamental to the operation of Klipper is the handling of clocks, times, "

"Klipper is critical to correct operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are three types of times tracked internally in the Klipper host "
"software:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"System time. The system time uses the system's monotonic clock - it is a "
"floating point number stored as seconds and it is (generally) relative to "
"when the host computer was last started. System times have limited use in "
"the software - they are primarily used when interacting with the operating "
"system. Within the host code, system times are frequently stored in "
"variables named *eventtime* or *curtime*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print time. The print time is synchronized to the main micro-controller "
"clock (the micro-controller defined in the \"[mcu]\" config section). It is "
"a floating point number stored as seconds and is relative to when the main "
"mcu was last restarted. It is possible to convert from a \"print time\" to "
"the main micro-controller's hardware clock by multiplying the print time by "
"the mcu's statically configured frequency rate. The high-level host code "
"uses print times to calculate almost all physical actions (eg, head "
"movement, heater changes, etc.). Within the host code, print times are "
"generally stored in variables named *print_time* or *move_time*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MCU clock. This is the hardware clock counter on each micro-controller. It "
"is stored as an integer and its update rate is relative to the frequency of "
"the given micro-controller. The host software translates its internal times "
"to clocks before transmission to the mcu. The mcu code only ever tracks time"
" in clock ticks. Within the host code, clock values are tracked as 64bit "
"integers, while the mcu code uses 32bit integers. Within the host code, "
"clocks are generally stored in variables with names containing *clock* or "
"*ticks*."

msgid ""
"Conversion between the different time formats is primarily implemented in "

msgid "Some things to be aware of when reviewing the code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"32bit and 64bit clocks: To reduce bandwidth and to improve micro-controller "
"efficiency, clocks on the micro-controller are tracked as 32bit integers. "
"When comparing two clocks in the mcu code, the `timer_is_before()` function "
"must always be used to ensure integer rollovers are handled properly. The "
"host software converts 32bit clocks to 64bit clocks by appending the high-"
"order bits from the last mcu timestamp it has received - no message from the"
" mcu is ever more than 2^31 clock ticks in the future or past so this "
"conversion is never ambiguous. The host converts from 64bit clocks to 32bit "
"clocks by simply truncating the high-order bits. To ensure there is no "
"ambiguity in this conversion, the **klippy/chelper/serialqueue.c** code will"
" buffer messages until they are within 2^31 clock ticks of their target "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple micro-controllers: The host software supports using multiple micro-"
"controllers on a single printer. In this case, the \"MCU clock\" of each "
"micro-controller is tracked separately. The clocksync.py code handles clock "
"drift between micro-controllers by modifying the way it converts from "
"\"print time\" to \"MCU clock\". On secondary mcus, the mcu frequency that "
"is used in this conversion is regularly updated to account for measured "
"drift."
