"Bed leveling (sometimes also referred to as \"bed tramming\") is critical to"
" getting high quality prints. If a bed is not properly \"leveled\" it can "
"lead to poor bed adhesion, \"warping\", and subtle problems throughout the "
"print. This document serves as a guide to performing bed leveling in "
"Klipper."

"打印床调平（有时也被称为 \"bed "

"It's important to understand the goal of bed leveling. If the printer is "
"commanded to a position `X0 Y0 Z10` during a print, then the goal is for the"
" printer's nozzle to be exactly 10mm from the printer's bed. Further, should"
" the printer then be commanded to a position of `X50 Z10` the goal is for "
"the nozzle to maintain an exact distance of 10mm from the bed during that "
"entire horizontal move."
msgstr ""
"了解打印床调平的目标很重要。如果打印机在打印过程中被命令到`X0 Y0 "
"Z10`的位置，那么目标是让打印机的喷嘴距离打印床正好10毫米。此外，如果打印机被命令到`X50 "
"Z10`的位置，目标是在整个水平移动过程中，喷嘴与床面始终保持10毫米的准确距离。"

"In order to get good quality prints the printer should be calibrated so that"
" Z distances are accurate to within about 25 microns (.025mm). This is a "
"small distance - significantly smaller than the width of a typical human "
"hair. This scale can not be measured \"by eye\". Subtle effects (such as "
"heat expansion) impact measurements at this scale. The secret to getting "
"high accuracy is to use a repeatable process and to use a leveling method "
"that leverages the high accuracy of the printer's own motion system."

"为了获得良好的打印质量，打印机应进行校准，使Z轴距离的精度在约25微米（0.025毫米）。这是一个很小的距离，远小于典型人类头发的宽度。这个尺度是不能 "
"\"用眼睛 \"来测量的。微妙的影响（如热膨胀）会影响这个尺度的测量。获得高精度的秘诀是使用一个可重复，高精度，并能够利用打印机自身运动系统的调平方法。"

msgstr "选择适当的校准机制"

msgid ""
"Different types of printers use different methods for performing bed "
"leveling. All of them ultimately depend on the \"paper test\" (described "
"below). However, the actual process for a particular type of printer is "
"described in other documents."

msgid ""
"Prior to running any of these calibration tools, be sure to run the checks "
"described in the [config check document](Config_checks.md). It is necessary "
"to verify basic printer motion before performing bed leveling."
msgstr ""
"在运行任何校准工具前，一定要执行在 [检查配置文档](Config_checks.md) 中 描述的检查步骤。在打印床调平前有必要验证打印机的基本运动。"

"For printers with an \"automatic Z probe\" be sure to calibrate the probe "
"following the directions in the [Probe Calibrate](Probe_Calibrate.md) "
"document. For delta printers, see the [Delta Calibrate](Delta_Calibrate.md) "
"document. For printers with bed screws and traditional Z endstops, see the "
"[Manual Level](Manual_Level.md) document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During calibration it may be necessary to set the printer's Z `position_min`"
" to a negative number (eg, `position_min = -2`). The printer enforces "
"boundary checks even during calibration routines. Setting a negative number "
"allows the printer to move below the nominal position of the bed, which may "
"help when trying to determine the actual bed position."
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"paper test\""
msgstr "“A4纸测试法”"

msgid ""
"The primary bed calibration mechanism is the \"paper test\". It involves "
"placing a regular piece of \"copy machine paper\" between the printer's bed "
"and nozzle, and then commanding the nozzle to different Z heights until one "
"feels a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to understand the \"paper test\" even if one has an "
"\"automatic Z probe\". The probe itself often needs to be calibrated to get "
"good results. That probe calibration is done using this \"paper test\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to perform the paper test, cut a small rectangular piece of paper "
"using a pair of scissors (eg, 5x3 cm). The paper generally has a width of "
"around 100 microns (0.100mm). (The exact width of the paper isn't crucial.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first step of the paper test is to inspect the printer's nozzle and bed."
" Make sure there is no plastic (or other debris) on the nozzle or bed."
msgstr "纸张测试的第一步是检查打印机的喷嘴和打印床。确保喷嘴和打印床面上没有塑料（或其他杂物）。"

msgid "**Inspect the nozzle and bed to ensure no plastic is present!**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one always prints on a particular tape or printing surface then one may "
"perform the paper test with that tape/surface in place. However, note that "
"tape itself has a width and different tapes (or any other printing surface) "
"will impact Z measurements. Be sure to rerun the paper test to measure each "
"type of surface that is in use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is plastic on the nozzle then heat up the extruder and use a metal "
"tweezers to remove that plastic. Wait for the extruder to fully cool to room"
" temperature before continuing with the paper test. While the nozzle is "
"cooling, use the metal tweezers to remove any plastic that may ooze out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Always perform the paper test when both nozzle and bed are at room "
"temperature!**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the nozzle is heated, its position (relative to the bed) changes due to"
" thermal expansion. This thermal expansion is typically around a 100 "
"microns, which is about the same width as a typical piece of printer paper. "
"The exact amount of thermal expansion isn't crucial, just as the exact width"
" of the paper isn't crucial. Start with the assumption that the two are "
"equal (see below for a method of determining the difference between the two "
"widths)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It may seem odd to calibrate the distance at room temperature when the goal "
"is to have a consistent distance when heated. However, if one calibrates "
"when the nozzle is heated, it tends to impart small amounts of molten "
"plastic on to the paper, which changes the amount of friction felt. That "
"makes it harder to get a good calibration. Calibrating while the bed/nozzle "
"is hot also greatly increases the risk of burning oneself. The amount of "
"thermal expansion is stable, so it is easily accounted for later in the "
"calibration process."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Use an automated tool to determine precise Z heights!**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper has several helper scripts available (eg, MANUAL_PROBE, "
"Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE, PROBE_CALIBRATE, DELTA_CALIBRATE). See the documents "
"[described above](#choose-the-appropriate-calibration-mechanism) to choose "
"one of them."
msgstr ""

"Run the appropriate command in the OctoPrint terminal window. The script "
"will prompt for user interaction in the OctoPrint terminal output. It will "
"look something like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The current height of the nozzle (as the printer currently understands it) "
"is shown between the \"--> <--\". The number to the right is the height of "
"the last probe attempt just greater than the current height, and to the left"
" is the last probe attempt less than the current height (or ?????? if no "
"attempt has been made)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Place the paper between the nozzle and bed. It can be useful to fold a "
"corner of the paper so that it is easier to grab. (Try not to push down on "
"the bed when moving the paper back and forth.)"

msgid ""
"Use the TESTZ command to request the nozzle to move closer to the paper. For"
" example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The TESTZ command will move the nozzle a relative distance from the nozzle's"
" current position. (So, `Z=-.1` requests the nozzle to move closer to the "
"bed by .1mm.) After the nozzle stops moving, push the paper back and forth "
"to check if the nozzle is in contact with the paper and to feel the amount "
"of friction. Continue issuing TESTZ commands until one feels a small amount "
"of friction when testing with the paper."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If too much friction is found then one can use a positive Z value to move "
"the nozzle up. It is also possible to use `TESTZ Z=+` or `TESTZ Z=-` to "
"\"bisect\" the last position - that is to move to a position half way "
"between two positions. For example, if one received the following prompt "
"from a TESTZ command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then a `TESTZ Z=-` would move the nozzle to a Z position of 0.180 (half way "
"between 0.130 and 0.230). One can use this feature to help rapidly narrow "
"down to a consistent friction. It is also possible to use `Z=++` and `Z=--` "
"to return directly to a past measurement - for example, after the above "
"prompt a `TESTZ Z=--` command would move the nozzle to a Z position of "
"0.130."
msgstr ""

msgid "After finding a small amount of friction run the ACCEPT command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will accept the given Z height and proceed with the given calibration "
"tool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exact amount of friction felt isn't crucial, just as the amount of "
"thermal expansion and exact width of the paper isn't crucial. Just try to "
"obtain the same amount of friction each time one runs the test."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If something goes wrong during the test, one can use the `ABORT` command to "
"exit the calibration tool."
msgstr ""

msgid "Determining Thermal Expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After successfully performing bed leveling, one may go on to calculate a "
"more precise value for the combined impact of \"thermal expansion\", \"width"
" of the paper\", and \"amount of friction felt during the paper test\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This type of calculation is generally not needed as most users find the "
"simple \"paper test\" provides good results."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to make this calculation is to print a test object that has "
"straight walls on all sides. The large hollow square found in "
"[docs/prints/square.stl](prints/square.stl) can be used for this. When "
"slicing the object, make sure the slicer uses the same layer height and "
"extrusion widths for the first level that it does for all subsequent layers."
" Use a coarse layer height (the layer height should be around 75% of the "
"nozzle diameter) and do not use a brim or raft."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print the test object, wait for it to cool, and remove it from the bed. "
"Inspect the lowest layer of the object. (It may also be useful to run a "
"finger or nail along the bottom edge.) If one finds the bottom layer bulges "
"out slightly along all sides of the object then it indicates the nozzle was "
"slightly closer to the bed then it should be. One can issue a "
"`SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=+.010` command to increase the height. In subsequent "
"prints one can inspect for this behavior and make further adjustment as "
"needed. Adjustments of this type are typically in 10s of microns (.010mm)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the bottom layer consistently appears narrower than subsequent layers "
"then one can use the SET_GCODE_OFFSET command to make a negative Z "
"adjustment. If one is unsure, then one can decrease the Z adjustment until "
"the bottom layer of prints exhibit a small bulge, and then back-off until it"
" disappears."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to apply the desired Z adjustment is to create a START_PRINT"
" g-code macro, arrange for the slicer to call that macro during the start of"
" each print, and add a SET_GCODE_OFFSET command to that macro. See the "
"[slicers](Slicers.md) document for further details."
