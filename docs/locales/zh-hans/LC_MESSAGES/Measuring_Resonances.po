"However, you can also connect two accelerometers simultaneously, though they"

msgid "Max smoothing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the input shaper can create some smoothing in parts. "
"Automatic tuning of the input shaper performed by `calibrate_shaper.py` "
"script or `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` command tries not to exacerbate the smoothing, "
"but at the same time they try to minimize the resulting vibrations. "
"Sometimes they can make a sub-optimal choice of the shaper frequency, or "
"maybe you simply prefer to have less smoothing in parts at the expense of a "
"larger remaining vibrations. In these cases, you can request to limit the "
"maximum smoothing from the input shaper."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's consider the following results from the automatic tuning:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Resonances](img/calibrate-x.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the reported `smoothing` values are some abstract projected "
"values. These values can be used to compare different configurations: the "
"higher the value, the more smoothing a shaper will create. However, these "
"smoothing scores do not represent any real measure of smoothing, because the"
" actual smoothing depends on [`max_accel`](#selecting-max-accel) and "
"`square_corner_velocity` parameters. Therefore, you should print some test "
"prints to see how much smoothing exactly a chosen configuration creates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example above the suggested shaper parameters are not bad, but what "
"if you want to get less smoothing on the X axis? You can try to limit the "
"maximum shaper smoothing using the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"which limits the smoothing to 0.2 score. Now you can get the following "
"result:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Resonances](img/calibrate-x-max-smoothing.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you compare to the previously suggested parameters, the vibrations are a "
"bit larger, but the smoothing is significantly smaller than previously, "
"allowing larger maximum acceleration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When deciding which `max_smoothing` parameter to choose, you can use a "
"trial-and-error approach. Try a few different values and see which results "
"you get. Note that the actual smoothing produced by the input shaper "
"depends, primarily, on the lowest resonance frequency of the printer: the "
"higher the frequency of the lowest resonance - the smaller the smoothing. "
"Therefore, if you request the script to find a configuration of the input "
"shaper with the unrealistically small smoothing, it will be at the expense "
"of increased ringing at the lowest resonance frequencies (which are, "
"typically, also more prominently visible in prints). So, always double-check"
" the projected remaining vibrations reported by the script and make sure "
"they are not too high."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that if you chose a good `max_smoothing` value for both of your axes, "
"you can store it in the `printer.cfg` as"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, if you [rerun](#input-shaper-re-calibration) the input shaper auto-"
"tuning using `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` Klipper command in the future, it will use "
"the stored `max_smoothing` value as a reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting max_accel"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the input shaper can create some smoothing in parts, especially at "
"high accelerations, you will still need to choose the `max_accel` value that"
" does not create too much smoothing in the printed parts. A calibration "
"script provides an estimate for `max_accel` parameter that should not create"
" too much smoothing. Note that the `max_accel` as displayed by the "
"calibration script is only a theoretical maximum at which the respective "
"shaper is still able to work without producing too much smoothing. It is by "
"no means a recommendation to set this acceleration for printing. The maximum"
" acceleration your printer is able to sustain depends on its mechanical "
"properties and the maximum torque of the used stepper motors. Therefore, it "
"is suggested to set `max_accel` in `[printer]` section that does not exceed "
"the estimated values for X and Y axes, likely with some conservative safety "
"margin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, follow [this](Resonance_Compensation.md#selecting-max_accel) "
"part of the input shaper tuning guide and print the test model to choose "
"`max_accel` parameter experimentally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same notice applies to the input shaper [auto-calibration](#input-"
"shaper-auto-calibration) with `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` command: it is still "
"necessary to choose the right `max_accel` value after the auto-calibration, "
"and the suggested acceleration limits will not be applied automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are doing a shaper re-calibration and the reported smoothing for the "
"suggested shaper configuration is almost the same as what you got during the"
" previous calibration, this step can be skipped."
msgstr ""

msgid "Input Shaper auto-calibration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides manually choosing the appropriate parameters for the input shaper "
"feature, it is also possible to run the auto-tuning for the input shaper "
"directly from Klipper. Run the following command via Octoprint terminal:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will run the full test for both axes and generate the csv output "
"(`/tmp/calibration_data_*.csv` by default) for the frequency response and "
"the suggested input shapers. You will also get the suggested frequencies for"
" each input shaper, as well as which input shaper is recommended for your "
"setup, on Octoprint console. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you agree with the suggested parameters, you can execute `SAVE_CONFIG` "
"now to save them and restart the Klipper. Note that this will not update "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Warning!** It is not advisable to run the shaper autocalibration very "
"frequently (e.g. before every print, or every day). In order to determine "
"resonance frequencies, autocalibration creates intensive vibrations on each "
"of the axes. Generally, 3D printers are not designed to withstand a "
"prolonged exposure to vibrations near the resonance frequencies. Doing so "
"may increase wear of the printer components and reduce their lifespan. There"
" is also an increased risk of some parts unscrewing or becoming loose. "
"Always check that all parts of the printer (including the ones that may "
"normally not move) are securely fixed in place after each auto-tuning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
