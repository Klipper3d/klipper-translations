"Short answer: A mapping is available in the [sample-"
"aliases.cfg](../config/sample-aliases.cfg) file. Use that file as a guide to"
" finding the actual micro-controller pin names. (It is also possible to copy"
" the relevant [board_pins](Config_Reference.md#board_pins) config section "
"into your config file and use the aliases in your config, but it is "
"preferable to translate and use the actual micro-controller pin names.) Note"
" that the sample-aliases.cfg file uses pin names that start with the prefix "
"\"ar\" instead of \"D\" (eg, Arduino pin `D23` is Klipper alias `ar23`) and "
"the prefix \"analog\" instead of \"A\" (eg, Arduino pin `A14` is Klipper "
"alias `analog14`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long answer: Klipper uses the standard pin names defined by the micro-"
"controller. On the Atmega chips these hardware pins have names like `PA4`, "
"`PC7`, or `PD2`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long ago, the Arduino project decided to avoid using the standard hardware "
"names in favor of their own pin names based on incrementing numbers - these "
"Arduino names generally look like `D23` or `A14`. This was an unfortunate "
"choice that has lead to a great deal of confusion. In particular the Arduino"
" pin numbers frequently don't translate to the same hardware names. For "
"example, `D21` is `PD0` on one common Arduino board, but is `PC7` on another"
" common Arduino board."

msgid ""
"To avoid this confusion, the core Klipper code uses the standard pin names "

msgid ""
"Do I have to wire my device to a specific type of micro-controller pin?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It depends on the type of device and type of pin:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"ADC pins (or Analog pins): For thermistors and similar \"analog\" sensors, "
"the device must be wired to an \"analog\" or \"ADC\" capable pin on the "
"micro-controller. If you configure Klipper to use a pin that is not analog "
"capable, Klipper will report a \"Not a valid ADC pin\" error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PWM pins (or Timer pins): Klipper does not use hardware PWM by default for "
"any device. So, in general, one may wire heaters, fans, and similar devices "
"to any general purpose IO pin. However, fans and output_pin devices may be "
"optionally configured to use `hardware_pwm: True`, in which case the micro-"
"controller must support hardware PWM on the pin (otherwise, Klipper will "
"report a \"Not a valid PWM pin\" error)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"IRQ pins (or Interrupt pins): Klipper does not use hardware interrupts on IO"
" pins, so it is never necessary to wire a device to one of these micro-"
"controller pins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SPI pins: When using hardware SPI it is necessary to wire the pins to the "
"micro-controller's SPI capable pins. However, most devices can be configured"
" to use \"software SPI\", in which case any general purpose IO pins may be "
"used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I2C pins: When using I2C it is necessary to wire the pins to the micro-"
"controller's I2C capable pins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other devices may be wired to any general purpose IO pin. For example, "
"steppers, heaters, fans, Z probes, servos, LEDs, common hd44780/st7920 LCD "
"displays, the Trinamic UART control line may be wired to any general purpose"
" IO pin."

msgid "How do I cancel an M109/M190 \"wait for temperature\" request?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigate to the OctoPrint terminal tab and issue an M112 command in the "
"terminal box. The M112 command will cause Klipper to enter into a "
"\"shutdown\" state, and it will cause OctoPrint to disconnect from Klipper. "
"Navigate to the OctoPrint connection area and click on \"Connect\" to cause "
"OctoPrint to reconnect. Navigate back to the terminal tab and issue a "
"FIRMWARE_RESTART command to clear the Klipper error state. After completing "
"this sequence, the previous heating request will be canceled and a new print"
" may be started."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I find out whether the printer has lost steps?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a way, yes. Home the printer, issue a `GET_POSITION` command, run your "
"print, home again and issue another `GET_POSITION`. Then compare the values "
"in the `mcu:` line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This might be helpful to tune settings like stepper motor currents, "
"accelerations and speeds without needing to actually print something and "
"waste filament: just run some high-speed moves in between the `GET_POSITION`"
" commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that endstop switches themselves tend to trigger at slightly different "
"positions, so a difference of a couple of microsteps is likely the result of"
" endstop inaccuracies. A stepper motor itself can only lose steps in "
"increments of 4 full steps. (So, if one is using 16 microsteps, then a lost "
"step on the stepper would result in the \"mcu:\" step counter being off by a"
" multiple of 64 microsteps.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why does Klipper report errors? I lost my print!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Short answer: We want to know if our printers detect a problem so that the "
"underlying issue can be fixed and we can obtain great quality prints. We "
"definitely do not want our printers to silently produce low quality prints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long answer: Klipper has been engineered to automatically workaround many "
"transient problems. For example, it automatically detects communication "
"errors and will retransmit; it schedules actions in advance and buffers "
"commands at multiple layers to enable precise timing even with intermittent "
"interference. However, should the software detect an error that it can not "
"recover from, if it is commanded to take an invalid action, or if it detects"
" it is hopelessly unable to perform its commanded task, then Klipper will "
"report an error. In these situations there is a high risk of producing a "
"low-quality print (or worse). It is hoped that alerting the user will "
"empower them to fix the underlying issue and improve the overall quality of "
"their prints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some related questions: Why doesn't Klipper pause the print "
"instead? Report a warning instead? Check for errors before the print? Ignore"
" errors in user typed commands? etc? Currently Klipper reads commands using "
"the G-Code protocol, and unfortunately the G-Code command protocol is not "
"flexible enough to make these alternatives practical today. There is "
"developer interest in improving the user experience during abnormal events, "
"but it is expected that will require notable infrastructure work (including "
"a shift away from G-Code)."
