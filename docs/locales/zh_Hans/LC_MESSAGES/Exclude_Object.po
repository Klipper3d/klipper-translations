"Unlike other 3D printer firmware options, a printer running Klipper utilizes"
" a suite of components and users have many options to choose from. "
"Therefore, in order to provide a a consistent user experience, the "
"`[exclude_object]` module will establish a contract or API of sorts. The "
"contract covers the contents of the gcode file, how the internal state of "
"the module is controlled, and how that state is provided to clients."

" hull for showing more detailed visualizations of the printed objects. "
