msgid ""
"An accurate Z endstop position is critical to obtaining high quality prints."
msgstr "准确的 Z 轴限位位置对于获得高质量打印至关重要。"

msgid ""
"Note, though, the accuracy of the Z endstop switch itself can be a limiting "
"factor. If one is using Trinamic stepper motor drivers then consider "
"enabling [endstop phase](Endstop_Phase.md) detection to improve the accuracy"
" of the switch."
msgstr ""
"请注意，Z 限位开关本身的精度限制了调平的精度。如果使用 Trinamic "
"步进电机驱动，那么可以考虑启用[限位相位](Endstop_Phase.md)检测以提高开关的精度。"

msgid ""
"To perform a Z endstop calibration, home the printer, command the head to "
"move to a Z position that is at least five millimeters above the bed (if it "
"is not already), command the head to move to an XY position near the center "
"of the bed, then navigate to the OctoPrint terminal tab and run:"
msgstr ""
"要进行Z轴限位校准，请归位打印机，命令打印头移动到离床身至少5毫米的Z轴位置（如果还没有），命令打印头移动到靠近床身中心的XY位置，然后到OctoPrint终端中并且运行："

msgid ""
"It's preferable to use a Z endstop switch on the opposite end of the Z axis "
"from the bed. (Homing away from the bed is more robust as then it is "
"generally always safe to home the Z.) However, if one must home towards the "
"bed it is recommended to adjust the endstop so that it triggers a small "
"distance (eg, .5mm) above the bed. Almost all endstop switches can safely be"
" depressed a small distance beyond their trigger point. When this is done, "
"one should find that the `Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE` command reports a small "
"positive value (eg, .5mm) for the Z position_endstop. Triggering the endstop"
" while it is still some distance from the bed reduces the risk of "
"inadvertent bed crashes."
msgstr ""
"最好是在Z轴与加热床面之间使用Z限位开关（远离床面的限位开关更加稳定安全，因为这样的话，Z轴的原点通常是安全的）。然而，如果必须向加热床归位，建议调整限位开关，使其在加热床床面上方一小段距离（例如0.5毫米）触发。几乎所有的限位开关都可以在触发点以外的一小段距离安全地压下。当这样做时，你会发现`Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE`命令输出一个小的正值（比如0.5毫米）的Z限位位置。"

msgid ""
"Some printers have the ability to manually adjust the location of the "
"physical endstop switch. However, it's recommended to perform Z endstop "
"positioning in software with Klipper - once the physical location of the "

msgid "Adjusting bed leveling screws"
msgstr "调整打印调平螺丝"

msgid ""
"The secret to getting good bed leveling with bed leveling screws is to "
"utilize the printer's high precision motion system during the bed leveling "
"process itself. This is done by commanding the nozzle to a position near "
"each bed screw and then adjusting that screw until the bed is a set distance"
" from the nozzle. Klipper has a tool to assist with this. In order to use "
"the tool it is necessary to specify each screw XY location."
msgstr ""
"使用打印床调平螺丝获得平整打印床的秘诀是在床身调平过程中利用打印机高精度的运动系统，通过将喷嘴命令到每个调平螺丝附近的位置，然后调整该螺丝直到床与喷嘴保持固定的距离。Klipper"
" 的一个内置工具可以协助解决这个问题。为了使用该工具，必须指定每个螺丝的XY坐标。"

msgid ""
"This is done by creating a `[bed_screws]` config section. For example, it "
"might look something similar to:"
msgstr "这是通过创建一个`[bed_screws]`配置部分来实现的。例如，它可能看起来类似于以下内容:"

msgid ""
"If a bed screw is under the bed, then specify the XY position directly above"
" the screw. If the screw is outside the bed then specify an XY position "
"closest to the screw that is still within the range of the bed."
msgstr "如果床头调平螺丝在床下，则指定调平螺丝正上方的XY位置。如果螺钉在床身外，则指定一个最接近调平螺丝的XY位置，但仍在床身的范围内。"

msgid ""
"Once the config file is ready, run `RESTART` to load that config, and then "
"one can start the tool by running:"
msgstr "一旦配置文件准备好了，运行`RESTART`来加载该配置，然后就可以通过运行以下命令使用工具:"

msgid ""
"This tool will move the printer's nozzle to each screw XY location and then "
"move the nozzle to a Z=0 height. At this point one can use the \"paper "
"test\" to adjust the bed screw directly under the nozzle. See the "
"information described in [\"the paper test\"](Bed_Level.md#the-paper-test), "
"but adjust the bed screw instead of commanding the nozzle to different "
"heights. Adjust the bed screw until there is a small amount of friction when"
" pushing the paper back and forth."
msgstr ""
"这个工具将把打印机的喷嘴移动到每个调平螺丝的XY位置，然后把喷嘴移动到Z=0的高度。在这一点上，可以使用\"纸张测试\"来直接调整喷嘴下方的热床调平螺母。参见[\"纸张测试\"](Bed_Level.md#the-"
"paper-test)中描述的信息，但要调整的是热床螺母而不是指定喷头到不同的高度。调整热床调平螺母，直到来回推送纸张时有少量的摩擦。"

msgid ""
"Once the screw is adjusted so that a small amount of friction is felt, run "
"either the `ACCEPT` or `ADJUSTED` command. Use the `ADJUSTED` command if the"
" bed screw needed an adjustment (typically anything more than about 1/8th of"
" a turn of the screw). Use the `ACCEPT` command if no significant adjustment"
" is necessary. Both commands will cause the tool to proceed to the next "
"screw. (When an `ADJUSTED` command is used, the tool will schedule an "
"additional cycle of bed screw adjustments; the tool completes successfully "
"when all bed screws are verified to not require any significant "
"adjustments.) One can use the `ABORT` command to exit the tool early."
msgstr ""
"一旦螺丝被调整到可以感觉到少量的摩擦，运行`ACCEPT`或者`ADJUSTED`命令。如果床身螺丝需要调整（通常是任何超过1/8圈的转动），使用`ADJUSTED`命令。如果没有必要进行重大调整，则使用`ACCEPT`命令。这两条命令都会使工具进入下一个螺丝。(当使用`ADJUSTED`命令时，工具将安排一个额外的床身螺钉调整周期；当所有热床调平螺丝被确认不需要任何重大调整时，工具成功完成。)也可以使用`ABORT`命令来提前退出工具。"

msgid ""
"This system works best when the printer has a flat printing surface (such as"
" glass) and has straight rails. Upon successful completion of the bed "
"leveling tool the bed should be ready for printing."
msgstr "这个系统在打印机有一个平整的打印表面（如玻璃）并有笔直的导轨时效果最好。在成功完成打印床调平工具后，热床应该准备好进行打印。"

msgid "Fine grained bed screw adjustments"
msgstr "细颗粒热床调平螺丝调整"

msgid ""
"If the printer uses three bed screws and all three screws are under the bed,"
" then it may be possible to perform a second \"high precision\" bed leveling"
" step. This is done by commanding the nozzle to locations where the bed "
"moves a larger distance with each bed screw adjustment."
msgstr ""
"如果打印机使用三个热床调平螺丝，并且所有三个调平螺丝都在热床下面，那么就有可能执行第二个\"高精度\"热床调平步骤。这是通过命令喷头到热床当在每次调整床身时移动较大距离的位置来实现的。"

msgstr "例如，考虑一张在A B C位置有螺丝的打印平台："

msgid "![bed_screws](img/bed_screws.svg.png)"
msgstr "![bed_screws](img/bed_screws.svg.png)"

msgid ""
"For each adjustment made to the bed screw at location C, the bed will swing "
"along a pendulum defined by the remaining two bed screws (shown here as a "
"green line). In this situation, each adjustment to the bed screw at C will "
"move the bed at position D a further amount than directly at C. It is thus "
"possible to make an improved C screw adjustment when the nozzle is at "
"position D."
msgstr ""
"在位于C位置的螺丝每次调整间，打印床/打印头将沿着由其余两个螺丝定义的坐标摆锤摆动（此处显示为绿线）。在这种情况下，每次调整C处的床螺钉都会使打印床在位置D处移动比在C处移动更多的量。因此，可以通过将喷嘴置于D位置进行对C位置螺丝的精确调整。"

msgid ""
"To enable this feature, one would determine the additional nozzle "
"coordinates and add them to the config file. For example, it might look "
"like:"
msgstr "要启用此功能，需要定义额外的喷嘴坐标并将其添加到配置文件中。例如："

msgid ""
"When this feature is enabled, the `BED_SCREWS_ADJUST` tool will first prompt"
" for coarse adjustments directly above each screw position, and once those "
"are accepted, it will prompt for fine adjustments at the additional "
"locations. Continue to use `ACCEPT` and `ADJUSTED` at each position."
msgstr ""
"当此功能被启用时，`BED_SCREWS_ADJUST`工具将先提示在每个螺钉位置正上方进行粗调"
"，一旦这些被接受，它将提示在其他位置进行细调。继续在每个位置使用`ACCEPT`和`AD"
"JUSTED`。"

msgid "Adjusting bed leveling screws using the bed probe"
msgstr "使用打印床探针调整打印床调平螺丝"

msgid ""
"This is another way to calibrate the bed level using the bed probe. To use "
"it you must have a Z probe (BL Touch, Inductive sensor, etc)."
msgstr "这是用打印床探头调平的另一种方法。要使用它，你必须有一个Z探针（BL "
"Touch，电感式传感器等）。"

msgid ""
"To enable this feature, one would determine the nozzle coordinates such that"
" the Z probe is above the screws, and then add them to the config file. For "
"example, it might look like:"

"Repeat the process several times until you get a good level bed - normally "
"when all adjustments are below 6 minutes."
msgstr "重复这个过程几次，直到打印床变得足够水平--"
"通常情况下，这意味着所有的位置需要的调整都小于6分钟。"

msgid ""
"If using a probe that is mounted on the side of the hotend (that is, it has "
"an X or Y offset) then note that adjusting the bed tilt will invalidate any "
"previous probe calibration that was performed with a tilted bed. Be sure to "
"run [probe calibration](Probe_Calibrate.md) after the bed screws have been "

msgstr ""
"如果使用安装在热端侧面的探头（即它有一个X或Y偏移），那么请注意，调整床身倾斜"

msgid ""
"The `MAX_DEVIATION` parameter is useful when a saved bed mesh is used, to "
"ensure that the bed level has not drifted too far from where it was when the"
" mesh was created. For example, `SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE MAX_DEVIATION=0.01` "
"can be added to the custom start gcode of the slicer before the mesh is "
"loaded. It will abort the print if the configured limit is exceeded (0.01mm "
