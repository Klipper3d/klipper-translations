msgid "Translating gcode files to micro-controller commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klippy host code can run in a batch mode to produce the low-level micro-"
"controller commands associated with a gcode file. Inspecting these low-level"
" commands is useful when trying to understand the actions of the low-level "
"hardware. It can also be useful to compare the difference in micro-"
"controller commands after a code change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To run Klippy in this batch mode, there is a one time step necessary to "
"generate the micro-controller \"data dictionary\". This is done by compiling"
" the micro-controller code to obtain the **out/klipper.dict** file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the above is done it is possible to run Klipper in batch mode (see "
"[installation](Installation.md) for the steps necessary to build the python "
"virtual environment and a printer.cfg file):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above will produce a file **test.serial** with the binary serial output."
" This output can be translated to readable text with:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting file **test.txt** contains a human readable list of micro-"
"controller commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The batch mode disables certain response / request commands in order to "
"function. As a result, there will be some differences between actual "
"commands and the above output. The generated data is useful for testing and "
"inspection; it is not useful for sending to a real micro-controller."
msgstr ""

msgid "Testing with simulavr"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The [simulavr](http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/) tool enables one to simulate"
" an Atmel ATmega micro-controller. This section describes how one can run "
"test gcode files through simulavr. It is recommended to run this on a "
"desktop class machine (not a Raspberry Pi) as it does require significant "
"cpu to run efficiently."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use simulavr, download the simulavr package and compile with python "
"support:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the build system may need to have some packages (such as swig) "
"installed in order to build the python module. Make sure the file "
"**src/python/_pysimulavr.so** is present after the above compilation."
msgstr ""

msgid "To compile Klipper for use in simulavr, run:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, with simulavr running in another window, one can run the following to "
"read gcode from a file (eg, \"test.gcode\"), process it with Klippy, and "
"send it to Klipper running in simulavr (see [installation](Installation.md) "
"for the steps necessary to build the python virtual environment):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using simulavr with gtkwave"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One useful feature of simulavr is its ability to create signal wave "
"generation files with the exact timing of events. To do this, follow the "
"directions above, but run avrsim.py with a command-line like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above would create a file **avrsim.vcd** with information on each change"
" to the GPIOs on PORTA and PORTB. This could then be viewed using gtkwave "
"with:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Manually sending commands to the micro-controller"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, the host klippy.py process would be used to translate gcode "
"commands to Klipper micro-controller commands. However, it's also possible "
"to manually send these MCU commands (functions marked with the "
"DECL_COMMAND() macro in the Klipper source code). To do so, run:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the \"HELP\" command within the tool for more information on its "
"functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some command-line options are available. For more information run: "
"`~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/console.py --help`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Generating load graphs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) stores statistics on bandwidth, micro-"
"controller load, and host buffer load. It can be useful to graph these "
"statistics after a print."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To generate a graph, a one time step is necessary to install the "
"\"matplotlib\" package:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then graphs can be produced with:"
msgstr ""

msgid "One can then view the resulting **loadgraph.png** file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different graphs can be produced. For more information run: "
"`~/klipper/scripts/graphstats.py --help`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Extracting information from the klippy.log file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) also contains debugging information. "
"There is a logextract.py script that may be useful when analyzing a micro-"
"controller shutdown or similar problem. It is typically run with something "
"like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script will extract the printer config file and will extract MCU "
"shutdown information. The information dumps from an MCU shutdown (if "
"present) will be reordered by timestamp to assist in diagnosing cause and "
"effect scenarios."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running the regression tests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main Klipper GitHub repository uses \"github actions\" to run a series "
"of regression tests. It can be useful to run some of these tests locally."
