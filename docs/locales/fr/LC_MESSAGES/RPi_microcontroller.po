msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Often the MCUs dedicated to controlling 3D printers have a limited and pre-"
"configured number of exposed pins to manage the main printing functions "
"(thermal resistors, extruders, steppers ...). Using the RPi where Klipper is"
" installed as a secondary MCU gives the possibility to directly use the "
"GPIOs and the buses (i2c, spi) of the RPi inside klipper without using "
"Octoprint plugins (if used) or external programs giving the ability to "
"control everything within the print GCODE."

"**Warning**: If your platform is a *Beaglebone* and you have correctly "
"followed the installation steps, the linux mcu is already installed and "
"configured for your system."
