"Often the MCUs dedicated to controlling 3D printers have a limited and pre-"
"configured number of exposed pins to manage the main printing functions "
"(thermal resistors, extruders, steppers ...). Using the RPi where Klipper is"

"Octoprint plugins (if used) or external programs giving the ability to "
