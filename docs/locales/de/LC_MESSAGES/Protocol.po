"The Klipper messaging protocol is used for low-level communication between "
"the Klipper host software and the Klipper micro-controller software. At a "
"high level the protocol can be thought of as a series of command and "
"response strings that are compressed, transmitted, and then processed at the"
" receiving side. An example series of commands in uncompressed human-"
"readable format might look like:"
msgstr ""
"Das Klipper-Messaging-Protokoll wird für die Low-Level-Kommunikation "
"zwischen der Klipper-Host-Software und der Klipper-Mikrocontroller-Software "
"verwendet. Auf hoher Ebene kann man sich das Protokoll als eine Reihe von "
"Befehls- und Antwortzeichenfolgen vorstellen, die komprimiert, übertragen "
"und dann auf der Empfängerseite verarbeitet werden. Eine beispielhafte Reihe"
" von Befehlen in unkomprimiertem, für Menschen lesbarem Format könnte "

"See the [mcu commands](MCU_Commands.md) document for information on "
"available commands. See the [debugging](Debugging.md) document for "
"information on how to translate a G-Code file into its corresponding human-"
"readable micro-controller commands."
msgstr ""

"verfügbaren Befehlen. Siehe das Dokument [debugging](Debugging.md) für "
"Informationen darüber, wie eine G-Code-Datei in die entsprechenden "
"menschenlesbaren Mikrocontroller-Befehle übersetzt werden kann."

msgid ""
"This page provides a high-level description of the Klipper messaging "
"protocol itself. It describes how messages are declared, encoded in binary "
"format (the \"compression\" scheme), and transmitted."
msgstr ""
"Diese Seite enthält eine allgemeine Beschreibung des Klipper-"
"Nachrichtenprotokolls selbst. Sie beschreibt, wie Nachrichten deklariert, im "
"Binärformat kodiert (das \"Kompressionsschema\") und übertragen werden."

msgid ""
"The goal of the protocol is to enable an error-free communication channel "
"between the host and micro-controller that is low-latency, low-bandwidth, "
"and low-complexity for the micro-controller."
msgstr ""

msgid "Micro-controller Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klipper transmission protocol can be thought of as a "
"[RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) mechanism between"
" micro-controller and host. The micro-controller software declares the "
"commands that the host may invoke along with the response messages that it "
"can generate. The host uses that information to command the micro-controller"
" to perform actions and to interpret the results."
msgstr ""

msgid "Declaring commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The micro-controller software declares a \"command\" by using the "
"DECL_COMMAND() macro in the C code. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above declares a command named \"update_digital_out\". This allows the "
"host to \"invoke\" this command which would cause the "
"command_update_digital_out() C function to be executed in the micro-"
"controller. The above also indicates that the command takes two integer "
"parameters. When the command_update_digital_out() C code is executed, it "
"will be passed an array containing these two integers - the first "
"corresponding to the 'oid' and the second corresponding to the 'value'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, the parameters are described with printf() style syntax (eg, "
"\"%u\"). The formatting directly corresponds to the human-readable view of "
"commands (eg, \"update_digital_out oid=7 value=1\"). In the above example, "
"\"value=\" is a parameter name and \"%c\" indicates the parameter is an "
"integer. Internally, the parameter name is only used as documentation. In "
"this example, the \"%c\" is also used as documentation to indicate the "
"expected integer is 1 byte in size (the declared integer size does not "
"impact the parsing or encoding)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The micro-controller build will collect all commands declared with "
"DECL_COMMAND(), determine their parameters, and arrange for them to be "
"callable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Declaring responses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To send information from the micro-controller to the host a \"response\" is "
"generated. These are both declared and transmitted using the sendf() C "
"macro. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above transmits a \"status\" response message that contains two integer "
"parameters (\"clock\" and \"status\"). The micro-controller build "
"automatically finds all sendf() calls and generates encoders for them. The "
"first parameter of the sendf() function describes the response and it is in "
"the same format as command declarations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The host can arrange to register a callback function for each response. So, "
"in effect, commands allow the host to invoke C functions in the micro-"
"controller and responses allow the micro-controller software to invoke code "
"in the host."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sendf() macro should only be invoked from command or task handlers, and "
"it should not be invoked from interrupts or timers. The code does not need "
"to issue a sendf() in response to a received command, it is not limited in "
"the number of times sendf() may be invoked, and it may invoke sendf() at any"
" time from a task handler."
msgstr ""

msgid "Output responses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To simplify debugging, there is also an output() C function. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The output() function is similar in usage to printf() - it is intended to "
"generate and format arbitrary messages for human consumption."
msgstr ""

msgid "Declaring enumerations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enumerations allow the host code to use string identifiers for parameters "
"that the micro-controller handles as integers. They are declared in the "
"micro-controller code - for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the first example, the DECL_ENUMERATION() macro defines an enumeration "
"for any command/response message with a parameter name of \"spi_bus\" or "
"parameter name with a suffix of \"_spi_bus\". For those parameters the "
"string \"spi\" is a valid value and it will be transmitted with an integer "
"value of zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's also possible to declare an enumeration range. In the second example, a"
" \"pin\" parameter (or any parameter with a suffix of \"_pin\") would accept"
" PC0, PC1, PC2, ..., PC7 as valid values. The strings will be transmitted "
"with integers 16, 17, 18, ..., 23."
msgstr ""

msgid "Declaring constants"
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants can also be exported. For example, the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"would export a constant named \"SERIAL_BAUD\" with a value of 250000 from "
"the micro-controller to the host. It is also possible to declare a constant "
"that is a string - for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Low-level message encoding"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To accomplish the above RPC mechanism, each command and response is encoded "
"into a binary format for transmission. This section describes the "
"transmission system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Message Blocks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All data sent from host to micro-controller and vice-versa are contained in "
"\"message blocks\". A message block has a two byte header and a three byte "
"trailer. The format of a message block is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The length byte contains the number of bytes in the message block including "
"the header and trailer bytes (thus the minimum message length is 5 bytes). "
"The maximum message block length is currently 64 bytes. The sequence byte "
"contains a 4 bit sequence number in the low-order bits and the high-order "
"bits always contain 0x10 (the high-order bits are reserved for future use). "
"The content bytes contain arbitrary data and its format is described in the "
"following section. The crc bytes contain a 16bit CCITT "
"[CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) of the message "
"block including the header bytes but excluding the trailer bytes. The sync "
"byte is 0x7e."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The format of the message block is inspired by "
"[HDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control) message "
"frames. Like in HDLC, the message block may optionally contain an additional"
" sync character at the start of the block. Unlike in HDLC, a sync character "
"is not exclusive to the framing and may be present in the message block "
"content."
msgstr ""

msgid "Message Block Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each message block sent from host to micro-controller contains a series of "
"zero or more message commands in its contents. Each command starts with a "
"[Variable Length Quantity](#variable-length-quantities) (VLQ) encoded "
"integer command-id followed by zero or more VLQ parameters for the given "
"command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, the following four commands might be placed in a single "
"message block:"
msgstr ""

msgid "and encoded into the following eight VLQ integers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to encode and parse the message contents, both the host and micro-"
"controller must agree on the command ids and the number of parameters each "
"command has. So, in the above example, both the host and micro-controller "
"would know that \"id_update_digital_out\" is always followed by two "
"parameters, and \"id_get_config\" and \"id_get_clock\" have zero parameters."
" The host and micro-controller share a \"data dictionary\" that maps the "
"command descriptions (eg, \"update_digital_out oid=%c value=%c\") to their "
"integer command-ids. When processing the data, the parser will know to "
"expect a specific number of VLQ encoded parameters following a given command"
" id."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The message contents for blocks sent from micro-controller to host follow "
"the same format. The identifiers in these messages are \"response ids\", but"
" they serve the same purpose and follow the same encoding rules. In "
"practice, message blocks sent from the micro-controller to the host never "
"contain more than one response in the message block contents."
msgstr ""

msgid "Variable Length Quantities"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-"
"length_quantity) for more information on the general format of VLQ encoded "
"integers. Klipper uses an encoding scheme that supports both positive and "
"negative integers. Integers close to zero use less bytes to encode and "
"positive integers typically encode using less bytes than negative integers. "
"The following table shows the number of bytes each integer takes to encode:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Integer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Variable length strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an exception to the above encoding rules, if a parameter to a command or "
"response is a dynamic string then the parameter is not encoded as a simple "
"VLQ integer. Instead it is encoded by transmitting the length as a VLQ "
"encoded integer followed by the contents itself:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command descriptions found in the data dictionary allow both the host "
"and micro-controller to know which command parameters use simple VLQ "
"encoding and which parameters use string encoding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data Dictionary"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order for meaningful communications to be established between micro-"
"controller and host, both sides must agree on a \"data dictionary\". This "
"data dictionary contains the integer identifiers for commands and responses "
"along with their descriptions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The micro-controller build uses the contents of DECL_COMMAND() and sendf() "
"macros to generate the data dictionary. The build automatically assigns "
"unique identifiers to each command and response. This system allows both the"
" host and micro-controller code to seamlessly use descriptive human-readable"
" names while still using minimal bandwidth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The host queries the data dictionary when it first connects to the micro-"
"controller. Once the host downloads the data dictionary from the micro-"
"controller, it uses that data dictionary to encode all commands and to parse"
" all responses from the micro-controller. The host must therefore handle a "
"dynamic data dictionary. However, to keep the micro-controller software "
"simple, the micro-controller always uses its static (compiled in) data "
"dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The data dictionary is queried by sending \"identify\" commands to the "
"micro-controller. The micro-controller will respond to each identify command"
" with an \"identify_response\" message. Since these two commands are needed "
"prior to obtaining the data dictionary, their integer ids and parameter "
"types are hard-coded in both the micro-controller and the host. The "
"\"identify_response\" response id is 0, the \"identify\" command id is 1. "
"Other than having hard-coded ids the identify command and its response are "
"declared and transmitted the same way as other commands and responses. No "
"other command or response is hard-coded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The format of the transmitted data dictionary itself is a zlib compressed "
"JSON string. The micro-controller build process generates the string, "
"compresses it, and stores it in the text section of the micro-controller "
"flash. The data dictionary can be much larger than the maximum message block"
" size - the host downloads it by sending multiple identify commands "
"requesting progressive chunks of the data dictionary. Once all chunks are "
"obtained the host will assemble the chunks, uncompress the data, and parse "
"the contents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to information on the communication protocol, the data "
"dictionary also contains the software version, enumerations (as defined by "
"DECL_ENUMERATION), and constants (as defined by DECL_CONSTANT)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Message flow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Message commands sent from host to micro-controller are intended to be "
"error-free. The micro-controller will check the CRC and sequence numbers in "
"each message block to ensure the commands are accurate and in-order. The "
"micro-controller always processes message blocks in-order - should it "
"receive a block out-of-order it will discard it and any other out-of-order "
"blocks until it receives blocks with the correct sequencing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The low-level host code implements an automatic retransmission system for "
"lost and corrupt message blocks sent to the micro-controller. To facilitate "
"this, the micro-controller transmits an \"ack message block\" after each "
"successfully received message block. The host schedules a timeout after "
"sending each block and it will retransmit should the timeout expire without "
"receiving a corresponding \"ack\". In addition, if the micro-controller "
"detects a corrupt or out-of-order block it may transmit a \"nak message "
"block\" to facilitate fast retransmission."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An \"ack\" is a message block with empty content (ie, a 5 byte message "
"block) and a sequence number greater than the last received host sequence "
"number. A \"nak\" is a message block with empty content and a sequence "
"number less than the last received host sequence number."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The protocol facilitates a \"window\" transmission system so that the host "
"can have many outstanding message blocks in-flight at a time. (This is in "
"addition to the many commands that may be present in a given message block.)"
" This allows maximum bandwidth utilization even in the event of transmission"
" latency. The timeout, retransmit, windowing, and ack mechanism are inspired"
" by similar mechanisms in "
"[TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the other direction, message blocks sent from micro-controller to host "
"are designed to be error-free, but they do not have assured transmission. "
"(Responses should not be corrupt, but they may go missing.) This is done to "
"keep the implementation in the micro-controller simple. There is no "
"automatic retransmission system for responses - the high-level code is "
"expected to be capable of handling an occasional missing response (usually "
"by re-requesting the content or setting up a recurring schedule of response "
"transmission). The sequence number field in message blocks sent to the host "
"is always one greater than the last received sequence number of message "
"blocks received from the host. It is not used to track sequences of response"
" message blocks."
