msgid ""
"The recommended hardware is a Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, or Raspberry "
"Pi 4."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper will run on a Raspberry Pi 1 and on the Raspberry Pi Zero, but these"

"send movement commands.) If you wish to run on one one of these slower "
"boards anyway, consider using the \"virtual_sdcard\" feature when printing "
"(see [config reference](Config_Reference.md#virtual_sdcard) for details)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper has been run on other machines. The Klipper host software only "

"real-time scheduling requirements. If, during a print, the host computer "
"also performs an intensive general-purpose computing task (such as "
"defragmenting a hard drive, 3d rendering, heavy swapping, etc.), then it may"
" cause Klipper to report print errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: If you are not using an OctoPi image, be aware that several Linux "
"distributions enable a \"ModemManager\" (or similar) package that can "

msgstr ""

msgid "Can I run multiple instances of Klipper on the same host machine?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to run multiple instances of the Klipper host software, but "

msgstr ""

msgid "Do I have to use OctoPrint?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Klipper software is not dependent on OctoPrint. It is possible to use "
"alternative software to send commands to Klipper, but doing so requires "

"configured to use \"/tmp/printer\" for the printer serial port."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why can't I move the stepper before homing the printer?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code does this to reduce the chance of accidentally commanding the head "
"into the bed or a wall. Once the printer is homed the software attempts to "
"verify each move is within the position_min/max defined in the config file. "
"If the motors are disabled (via an M84 or M18 command) then the motors will "
"need to be homed again prior to movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to move the head after canceling a print via OctoPrint, consider"
" changing the OctoPrint cancel sequence to do that for you. It's configured "
"in OctoPrint via a web browser under: Settings->GCODE Scripts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to move the head after a print finishes, consider adding the "
"desired movement to the \"custom g-code\" section of your slicer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the printer requires some additional movement as part of the homing "
"process itself (or fundamentally does not have a homing process) then "
"consider using a safe_z_home or homing_override section in the config file. "
"If you need to move a stepper for diagnostic or debugging purposes then "
"consider adding a force_move section to the config file. See [config "
"reference](Config_Reference.md#customized_homing) for further details on "
"these options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why is the Z position_endstop set to 0.5 in the default configs?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For cartesian style printers the Z position_endstop specifies how far the "
"nozzle is from the bed when the endstop triggers. If possible, it is "
"recommended to use a Z-max endstop and home away from the bed (as this "
"reduces the potential for bed collisions). However, if one must home towards"
" the bed then it is recommended to position the endstop so it triggers when "
"the nozzle is still a small distance away from the bed. This way, when "
"homing the axis, it will stop before the nozzle touches the bed. See the "
"[bed level document](Bed_Level.md) for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I converted my config from Marlin and the X/Y axes work fine, but I just get"
" a screeching noise when homing the Z axis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Short answer: First, make sure you have verified the stepper configuration "
"as described in the [config check document](Config_checks.md). If the "
"problem persists, try reducing the max_z_velocity setting in the printer "
"config."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long answer: In practice Marlin can typically only step at a rate of around "
"10000 steps per second. If it is requested to move at a speed that would "
"require a higher step rate then Marlin will generally just step as fast as "
"it can. Klipper is able to achieve much higher step rates, but the stepper "
"motor may not have sufficient torque to move at a higher speed. So, for a Z "
"axis with a high gearing ratio or high microsteps setting the actual "
"obtainable max_z_velocity may be smaller than what is configured in Marlin."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a good quality USB cable between the host machine and micro-controller. "
"Make sure the plugs are secure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure the printer's power supply is not being overloaded. (Power "

" chip.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Verify stepper, heater, and other printer wires are not crimped or frayed. "
"(Printer movement may place stress on a faulty wire causing it to lose "
"contact, briefly short, or generate excessive noise.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There have been reports of high USB noise when both the printer's power "
"supply and the host's 5V power supply are mixed. (If you find that the "
"micro-controller powers on when either the printer's power supply is on or "
"the USB cable is plugged in, then it indicates the 5V power supplies are "
"being mixed.) It may help to configure the micro-controller to use power "
"from only one source. (Alternatively, if the micro-controller board can not "
"configure its power source, one may modify a USB cable so that it does not "
"carry 5V power between the host and micro-controller.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "My Raspberry Pi keeps rebooting during prints"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is most likely do to voltage fluctuations. Follow the same "
"troubleshooting steps for a [\"Lost communication with MCU\"](#i-keep-"
"getting-random-lost-communication-with-mcu-errors) error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some old versions of the AVR bootloader have a known bug in watchdog event "
"handling. This typically manifests when the printer.cfg file has "
"restart_method set to \"command\". When the bug occurs, the AVR device will "
"be unresponsive until power is removed and reapplied to the device (the "
"power or status LEDs may also blink repeatedly until the power is removed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workaround is to use a restart_method other than \"command\" or to flash"
" an updated bootloader to the AVR device. Flashing a new bootloader is a one"
" time step that typically requires an external programmer - see "
"[Bootloaders](Bootloaders.md) for further details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Will the heaters be left on if the Raspberry Pi crashes?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The software has been designed to prevent that. Once the host enables a "
"heater, the host software needs to confirm that enablement every 5 seconds. "
"If the micro-controller does not receive a confirmation every 5 seconds it "
"goes into a \"shutdown\" state which is designed to turn off all heaters and"
" stepper motors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the \"config_digital_out\" command in the [MCU "
"commands](MCU_Commands.md) document for further details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, the micro-controller software is configured with a minimum and "
"maximum temperature range for each heater at startup (see the min_temp and "
"max_temp parameters in the [config reference](Config_Reference.md#extruder) "
"for details). If the micro-controller detects that the temperature is "
"outside of that range then it will also enter a \"shutdown\" state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Separately, the host software also implements code to check that heaters and"
" temperature sensors are functioning correctly. See the [config "
"reference](Config_Reference.md#verify_heater) for further details."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I convert a Marlin pin number to a Klipper pin name?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Short answer: A mapping is available in the [sample-"
"aliases.cfg](../config/sample-aliases.cfg) file. Use that file as a guide to"
" finding the actual micro-controller pin names. (It is also possible to copy"
" the relevant [board_pins](Config_Reference.md#board_pins) config section "
"into your config file and use the aliases in your config, but it is "
"preferable to translate and use the actual micro-controller pin names.) Note"
" that the sample-aliases.cfg file uses pin names that start with the prefix "
"\"ar\" instead of \"D\" (eg, Arduino pin `D23` is Klipper alias `ar23`) and "
"the prefix \"analog\" instead of \"A\" (eg, Arduino pin `A14` is Klipper "
"alias `analog14`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long answer: Klipper uses the standard pin names defined by the micro-"
"controller. On the Atmega chips these hardware pins have names like `PA4`, "
"`PC7`, or `PD2`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long ago, the Arduino project decided to avoid using the standard hardware "
"names in favor of their own pin names based on incrementing numbers - these "
"Arduino names generally look like `D23` or `A14`. This was an unfortunate "
"choice that has lead to a great deal of confusion. In particular the Arduino"
" pin numbers frequently don't translate to the same hardware names. For "
"example, `D21` is `PD0` on one common Arduino board, but is `PC7` on another"
" common Arduino board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid this confusion, the core Klipper code uses the standard pin names "
"defined by the micro-controller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do I have to wire my device to a specific type of micro-controller pin?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It depends on the type of device and type of pin:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"ADC pins (or Analog pins): For thermistors and similar \"analog\" sensors, "
"the device must be wired to an \"analog\" or \"ADC\" capable pin on the "
"micro-controller. If you configure Klipper to use a pin that is not analog "
"capable, Klipper will report a \"Not a valid ADC pin\" error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PWM pins (or Timer pins): Klipper does not use hardware PWM by default for "
"any device. So, in general, one may wire heaters, fans, and similar devices "
"to any general purpose IO pin. However, fans and output_pin devices may be "
"optionally configured to use `hardware_pwm: True`, in which case the micro-"
"controller must support hardware PWM on the pin (otherwise, Klipper will "
"report a \"Not a valid PWM pin\" error)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"IRQ pins (or Interrupt pins): Klipper does not use hardware interrupts on IO"
" pins, so it is never necessary to wire a device to one of these micro-"
"controller pins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SPI pins: When using hardware SPI it is necessary to wire the pins to the "
"micro-controller's SPI capable pins. However, most devices can be configured"
" to use \"software SPI\", in which case any general purpose IO pins may be "
"used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I2C pins: When using I2C it is necessary to wire the pins to the micro-"
"controller's I2C capable pins."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I cancel an M109/M190 \"wait for temperature\" request?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigate to the OctoPrint terminal tab and issue an M112 command in the "
"terminal box. The M112 command will cause Klipper to enter into a "
"\"shutdown\" state, and it will cause OctoPrint to disconnect from Klipper. "
"Navigate to the OctoPrint connection area and click on \"Connect\" to cause "
"OctoPrint to reconnect. Navigate back to the terminal tab and issue a "
"FIRMWARE_RESTART command to clear the Klipper error state. After completing "
"this sequence, the previous heating request will be canceled and a new print"
" may be started."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I find out whether the printer has lost steps?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a way, yes. Home the printer, issue a `GET_POSITION` command, run your "
"print, home again and issue another `GET_POSITION`. Then compare the values "
"in the `mcu:` line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This might be helpful to tune settings like stepper motor currents, "
"accelerations and speeds without needing to actually print something and "
"waste filament: just run some high-speed moves in between the `GET_POSITION`"
" commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that endstop switches themselves tend to trigger at slightly different "
"positions, so a difference of a couple of microsteps is likely the result of"
" endstop inaccuracies. A stepper motor itself can only lose steps in "
"increments of 4 full steps. (So, if one is using 16 microsteps, then a lost "
"step on the stepper would result in the \"mcu:\" step counter being off by a"
" multiple of 64 microsteps.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why does Klipper report errors? I lost my print!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Short answer: We want to know if our printers detect a problem so that the "
"underlying issue can be fixed and we can obtain great quality prints. We "
"definitely do not want our printers to silently produce low quality prints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long answer: Klipper has been engineered to automatically workaround many "
"transient problems. For example, it automatically detects communication "
"errors and will retransmit; it schedules actions in advance and buffers "
"commands at multiple layers to enable precise timing even with intermittent "
"interference. However, should the software detect an error that it can not "
"recover from, if it is commanded to take an invalid action, or if it detects"
" it is hopelessly unable to perform its commanded task, then Klipper will "
"report an error. In these situations there is a high risk of producing a "
"low-quality print (or worse). It is hoped that alerting the user will "
"empower them to fix the underlying issue and improve the overall quality of "
"their prints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some related questions: Why doesn't Klipper pause the print "
"instead? Report a warning instead? Check for errors before the print? Ignore"
" errors in user typed commands? etc? Currently Klipper reads commands using "
"the G-Code protocol, and unfortunately the G-Code command protocol is not "
"flexible enough to make these alternatives practical today. There is "
"developer interest in improving the user experience during abnormal events, "
"but it is expected that will require notable infrastructure work (including "
"a shift away from G-Code)."
