"Bed leveling (sometimes also referred to as \"bed tramming\") is critical to"
" getting high quality prints. If a bed is not properly \"leveled\" it can "
"lead to poor bed adhesion, \"warping\", and subtle problems throughout the "
"print. This document serves as a guide to performing bed leveling in "
"Klipper."

"列印床調平（有時也被稱為 \"bed tramming\"）對於獲得高質量的列印結果至關重要。錯誤\"調平\"的列印床會造成附著力差、\"翹曲\""

"It's important to understand the goal of bed leveling. If the printer is "
"commanded to a position `X0 Y0 Z10` during a print, then the goal is for the"
" printer's nozzle to be exactly 10mm from the printer's bed. Further, should"
" the printer then be commanded to a position of `X50 Z10` the goal is for "
"the nozzle to maintain an exact distance of 10mm from the bed during that "
"entire horizontal move."
msgstr ""
"瞭解列印床調平的目標很重要。如果印表機在列印過程中被命令到`X0 Y0 "
"Z10`的位置，那麼目標是讓印表機的噴嘴距離列印床正好10毫米。此外，如果印表機被命令到`X50 "
"Z10`的位置，目標是在整個水平移動過程中，噴嘴與床面始終保持10毫米的準確距離。"

"In order to get good quality prints the printer should be calibrated so that"
" Z distances are accurate to within about 25 microns (.025mm). This is a "
"small distance - significantly smaller than the width of a typical human "
"hair. This scale can not be measured \"by eye\". Subtle effects (such as "
"heat expansion) impact measurements at this scale. The secret to getting "
"high accuracy is to use a repeatable process and to use a leveling method "
"that leverages the high accuracy of the printer's own motion system."
msgstr ""
"爲了獲得良好的列印質量，印表機應進行校準，使Z軸距離的精度在約25微米（0.025毫米）。這是一個很小的距離，遠小於典型人類頭髮的寬度。這個尺度是不能 "

"During calibration it may be necessary to set the printer's Z `position_min`"
" to a negative number (eg, `position_min = -2`). The printer enforces "

"在校準過程中，可能需要將印表機的Z `position_min`設定為一個負數（例如，`position_min = "

msgid "The \"paper test\""
msgstr "「A4紙測試法」"

msgid ""
"The primary bed calibration mechanism is the \"paper test\". It involves "

"and nozzle, and then commanding the nozzle to different Z heights until one "
"feels a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth."
msgstr ""
"床調平的核心校準機制是\"塞紙測試\"。它涉及在列印床和噴嘴之間放置一張普通列印紙，然後將噴嘴控制到不同的Z高度，直到在來回移動紙張時感覺到適量的阻力。"

msgid ""
"It is important to understand the \"paper test\" even if one has an "

msgstr "即使你的印表機帶有自動Z探針，理解塞紙測試依然很重要。爲了保證探針的效果，它經常會需要校準。探針的校準機制也依賴塞紙測試。"

"If there is plastic on the nozzle then heat up the extruder and use a metal "

msgstr ""
"如果噴嘴上殘留了塑料，需要先加熱擠出頭並用金屬鑷子把這些塑料去除。等到擠出機完全冷卻到室溫後，再繼續進行紙張測試。當噴嘴正在冷卻時，使用金屬鑷子去除任何可"

msgid ""
"**Always perform the paper test when both nozzle and bed are at room "

msgstr "**只在噴嘴和列印床都處於室溫的情況下進行塞紙測試！**"

msgid ""
"It may seem odd to calibrate the distance at room temperature when the goal "
"is to have a consistent distance when heated. However, if one calibrates "
"when the nozzle is heated, it tends to impart small amounts of molten "
"plastic on to the paper, which changes the amount of friction felt. That "
"makes it harder to get a good calibration. Calibrating while the bed/nozzle "
"is hot also greatly increases the risk of burning oneself. The amount of "
"thermal expansion is stable, so it is easily accounted for later in the "
"calibration process."
msgstr ""
"當目標是在加熱時有一個一致的距離時，在室溫下校準距離可能聽起來很奇怪。然而，如果在噴嘴加熱時進行校準，往往會有少量的熔融塑料滲入紙張，從而改變了摩擦力的大"
"小。這會影響校準精度。在床或噴嘴熱的時候進行校準也會大大增加燒傷風險。熱膨脹量是穩定的，所以在校準過程中很容易被考慮到。"
