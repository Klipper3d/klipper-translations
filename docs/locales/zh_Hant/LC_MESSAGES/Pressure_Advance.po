"Typical pressure advance values are between 0.050 and 1.000 (the high end "

"The pressure advance value is dependent on the extruder, the nozzle, and the"
" filament. It is common for filament from different manufactures or with "
"different pigments to require significantly different pressure advance "
"values. Therefore, one should calibrate pressure advance on each printer and"
" with each spool of filament."
msgstr ""
"Pressure advance值取決於擠出機、噴嘴和細絲。"
"來自不同製造商或具有不同顏料的長絲通常需要顯著不同的pressure "
"advance值。因此，應該校準每台打印機上的pressure advance量以及每根燈絲捲軸。"

msgid ""
"Printing temperature and extrusion rates can impact pressure advance. Be "
"sure to tune the [extruder "
"rotation_distance](Rotation_Distance.md#calibrating-rotation_distance-on-"
"extruders) and [nozzle "
"temperature](http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter%27s_Calibration_Guide#Nozzle_Temperature)"

"The test print is designed to run with a high extruder flow rate, but "
"otherwise \"normal\" slicer settings. A high flow rate is obtained by using "
"a high printing speed (eg, 100mm/s) and a coarse layer height (typically "
"around 75% of the nozzle diameter). Other slicer settings should be similar "
"to their defaults (eg, perimeters of 2 or 3 lines, normal retraction "
"amount). It can be useful to set the external perimeter speed to be the same"
" speed as the rest of the print, but it is not a requirement."
msgstr ""
"測試打印設計為以高擠出機流速運行，但否則為“正常”切片機設置。通過使用高打印速"
"度（例如，100mm/s）和粗層高度（通常約為噴嘴直徑的 "
"75%）獲得高流速。其他切片器設置應與其默認設置相似（例如，2 或 3 行的周長，正"
"常的縮回量）。將外部周邊速度設置為與打印的其餘部分相同的速度可能很有用，但這"
"不是必需的。"

msgid ""
"It is common for the test print to show different behavior on each corner. "
"Often the slicer will arrange to change layers at one corner which can "
"result in that corner being significantly different from the remaining three"
" corners. If this occurs, then ignore that corner and tune pressure advance "
"using the other three corners. It is also common for the remaining corners "
"to vary slightly. (This can occur due to small differences in how the "
"printer's frame reacts to cornering in certain directions.) Try to choose a "
"value that works well for all the remaining corners. If in doubt, prefer a "
"lower pressure advance value."
msgstr ""
"測試打印在每個角落顯示不同的行為是很常見的。通常，切片器會安排在一個角落更改"
"圖層，這可能導致該角落與其餘三個角落明顯不同。如果發生這種情況，則忽略該角並"
"使用其他三個角調整壓力推進。其餘的角也有輕微的變化也是很常見的。 （這可能是由"
"於打印機框架對某些方向的拐角的反應存在微小差異。）嘗試選擇一個適用於所有剩餘"
"拐角的值。如果有疑問，請選擇較低的pressure advance值。"

msgid ""
"If a high pressure advance value (eg, over 0.200) is used then one may find "
"that the extruder skips when returning to the printer's normal acceleration."
" The pressure advance system accounts for pressure by pushing in extra "
"filament during acceleration and retracting that filament during "
"deceleration. With a high acceleration and high pressure advance the "
"extruder may not have enough torque to push the required filament. If this "
"occurs, either use a lower acceleration value or disable pressure advance."
msgstr ""
"如果使用高壓提前值（例如，超過 0.200），則可能會發現擠出機在返回到打印機的正"
"常加速度時會跳動。壓力推進系統通過在加速期間推入額外的燈絲並在減速期間縮回該"
"燈絲來解釋壓力。在高加速度和高壓推進下，擠出機可能沒有足夠的扭矩來推動所需的"
"長絲。如果發生這種情況，請使用較低的加速度值或禁用pressure advance。"

msgid ""
"Once pressure advance is tuned in Klipper, it may still be useful to "
"configure a small retract value in the slicer (eg, 0.75mm) and to utilize "
"the slicer's \"wipe on retract option\" if available. These slicer settings "
"may help counteract ooze caused by filament cohesion (filament pulled out of"
" the nozzle due to the stickiness of the plastic). It is recommended to "
"disable the slicer's \"z-lift on retract\" option."
msgstr ""
"一旦在 Klipper 中調整了pressure advance，在切片器中配置一個小的縮回值（例如 "
"0.75 毫米）並使用切片器的“縮回時擦除選項”（如果可用）可能仍然有用。這些切片器"
"設置可能有助於抵消由細絲內聚（由於塑料的粘性而從噴嘴中拉出細絲）引起的滲出。"
"建議禁用切片器的“縮回時的 z-lift”選項。"

msgid ""
"The pressure advance system does not change the timing or path of the "
"toolhead. A print with pressure advance enabled will take the same amount of"
" time as a print without pressure advance. Pressure advance also does not "
"change the total amount of filament extruded during a print. Pressure "
"advance results in extra extruder movement during move acceleration and "
"deceleration. A very high pressure advance setting will result in a very "
"large amount of extruder movement during acceleration and deceleration, and "
"no configuration setting places a limit on the amount of that movement."
msgstr ""
"壓力推進系統不會改變工具頭的時間或路徑。啟用壓力推進的打印將花費與沒有壓力推"
"進的打印相同的時間。pressure "
"advance也不會改變打印過程中擠出的長絲總量。在移動加速和減速過程中，pressure "
"advance會導致額外的擠出機移動。非常高的pressure advance設置將導致擠出機在加速"
"和減速過程中移動非常大，並且沒有配置設置對移動量進行限制。"
